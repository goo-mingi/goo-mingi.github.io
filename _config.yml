            As a Data Scientist at Storelink, I focus on online marketplaces. Below are some of the market analysis projects I have carried out:

              1) <mark>Brand Involvement Analysis</mark> : While consumers tend to refer to the rank when they purchase in online markets, some products are more influenced by their brands than the rank itself. We call this **Keywords in High Brand Involvement**. This model analyzes whether the products from the result of a keyword have high brand involvement or not. This model has become a **core competence** of my company, and we are now developing it for customers to use this model on our website.


              2) <mark>Customer Segmentation</mark> : We have many customers to buy the products of our business partners. To enhance the success rate of our marketing campaigns, I am developing a **customer segmentation model for targeted marketing**.


              3) <mark>Algorithm Detection<mark> : One of our top priorities is to expose our customers' products at the top of the search result site. Therefore, changes in the search algorithms are crucial to our business. I have identified the key variables that significantly impact search algorithms, as well as the timings of algorithm changes.

          At KHU, I learnt various business problems specializing in the hospitality industry. While the major was industry-specific, the methodology I have learnt was generalizable; statistics and business analytics allowed me to pursue an MSc in quantitative marketing. FYI, I was also interested in political science, so I took some courses of Korean politics and international relations.

          I was involved in many student clubs as follows:

          
            - Business Analytics and Consulting Club <mark>Co-founder</mark>

              - This club was so successful that the number of our alumni already exceeded twenty!
              
            - Service Strategic Management Club <mark>Leader</mark>
            
              - We studied strategic management, both from textbook study and from case study.
              - On every vacation, we carried out projects for service enterprises to apply our knowledge --- I was affiliated with BENIKEA headquarters, which is a hotel cooperative owned by the Korean government.
              - We proposed many marketing strategies to attract more customers, especially focusing on developing its unique style such as Providing traditional amenities and new branding to maintain its brand values.
              
            - Student Council <mark>Leader of PR Team</mark>
            
              - As the leader of the PR team, I was responsible for managing the social media accounts of my major.
              - To notify as many students as possible was my top priority --- I was always considering when to upload, how to upload and what to upload.
              
            - International Friendship and Culture Exchange Club <mark>Member</mark>
            
              - As a multilingual in East Asian languages, I was responsible to take care of many students from Chinese region and Japan.
              - One of my experience in this club includes to deal with an unusual situation involved with police, and the situation was solved easily, fortunately.
              - My best experience during my undergraduate that I could broaden my insights to languages, cultures and people.
