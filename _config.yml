  Hi, my name is **Mingi Goo**. I'm a **data scientist** from South Korea, currently working at **Storelink**. I have worked with <mark>R</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>, including **SQL**, **AWS** and **Github**, and utilized **Streamlit** to serve data analysis applications.

  My research interests lie in <mark>consumer search, e-commerce, digital marketing and search engine marketing</mark>, which was the focus of my [Master's thesis](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ArR47cH0ml_ji7cIz2DMQ0AXHxEZ1g?e=lhO3nT). With regard to methodology, I am intrigued by <mark>econometrical methodology</mark>, as well as <mark>machine learning techniques</mark> to investigate various data sets and <mark>Bayesian methodology</mark>.

  During my time at Seoul National University Graduate School, I rigorously studied these methodology and implemented related projects in the marketing department, with a particular focus **quantitative methods**.

  If you wish to know more about my professional background, you can refer to my [CV](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ArR47cH0ml_jjKhEWZHwgokPu995zw?e=Q4ftP8), or feel free to send an e-mail to me.

  I majored in **Hospitality Management** at Kyung Hee University as an undergraduate. You may wonder why the major changed so dramatically. One of my professors in KHU consistently emphasized that hospitality management should focus more on data science to better identify customer preferences. This inspired me to take courses in business statistics and business analytics.

  While taking these courses, I discovered that the methodologies were fascinating! Inferring populations from samples and deriving insights through analyzing and predicting captivated me, leading me to further pursue quantitative skills. As I delved into those skills, I realized that a focus on marketing would provide powerful tools for analysis.

  One of my unique hobbies is to study languages: I am fluent in <mark>English</mark>, <mark>Chinese(Mandarin)</mark>, <mark>Japanese</mark>, as well as my native language of <mark>Korean</mark>. This skill set stems from a keen interest in diverse cultures.

            As a Data Scientist at Storelink, my focus lies on online marketplaces. Below are some of the market analysis projects I've undertaken:

              - <mark>Brand Involvement Analysis</mark> : While consumers tend to refer to rankings when making purchase decisions in online markets, some products are more heavily influenced by their brands than the rankings themselves. We term these **Keywords in High Brand Involvement**. This model evaluates whether the products resulting from a keyword search exhibit high brand involvement. I took the initiative to develop this model from a **zero-base**, employing both **econometric methodologies** and **machine learning techniques**. This model has emerged as a **core competency** for our company, and we are currently developing a customer-facing version of it for our website, collaborating with software engineers.


              - <mark>Customer Segmentation</mark> : We aim to serve a diverse set of customers through our business partners. To increase the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, I am in the process of developing a customer segmentation model for **targeted marketing**.


              - <mark>Algorithm Detection</mark> : One of our top priorities is to ensure that our customers' products appear at the top of search result pages. Therefore, insights into changes in search algorithms are critical for our operations. I have identified key variables that markedly affect search algorithms, as well as pinpointed the timings when these algorithm changes occur.
