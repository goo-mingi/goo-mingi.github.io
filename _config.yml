  Hi, my name is Mingi Goo. I'm a data scientist from South Korea, currently working at Storelink. I have worked with <mark>R</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>, including SQL, AWS and Github, and utilized Streamlit to serve data analysis applications.

  One of my unusual hobbies is to study languages: I can speak <mark>English</mark>, <mark>Chinese(Mandarin)</mark>, <mark>Japanese</mark>, as well as my mother tongue <mark>Korean</mark>.

  I really like to travel all around the world! I want to list all the cities I have ever been to here!

  I've been to:
    - Asia : Seoul, Busan, Jeju, Gwangju, Gangneung, Taipei, Chia'yi, Keelung, Taichung, Guangzhou, Xianggelila, Lijiang, Dali, Kunming, Hong Kong, Fukuoka, Xining, Bangkok
    - Europe : London, Edinburgh, Brighton, Oxford, Glasgow, Rome, Positano, Florence, Milan, Venice, Interlaken, Vienna, Salzburg, Budapest, Prague, Munich, Berlin, Dresden, Koeln, Frankfurt am Main, Brussels, Paris
    - North America : Washington D.C., New York City, Boston

    While it may seem like I'm wealthy, the truth is I've worked really hard to fund my travels.


  I love <mark>sleeping</mark>, but I also enjoy going to the <mark>gym</mark> and <mark>running</mark>

          At my time at SNU, I collaborated on this project with 4 professors, including my advisor, and fellow graduate students, from the fields of Marketing, Information Systems and Finance Major. My responsibilities were as follows:

            1) <mark>Developing a comprehensive survey</mark> to understand customers' insurance purchasing journey and their digital behavior
            2) <mark>Analyzing the survey data</mark> to identify latent demand and effectively target potential customers
            3) <mark>Proposing field-specific tactics</mark> for potential customer segments

            As a Data Scientist at Storelink, I focus on online marketplaces. Below are some of the market analysis projects I have carried out:

              1) Brand Involvement Analysis : While consumers tend to refer to the rank when they purchase in online markets, some products are more influenced by their brands than the rank itself. We call this <mark>Keywords in High Brand Involvement</mark>. This model analyzes whether the products from the result of a keyword have high brand involvement or not. This model has become a core competence of my company, and we are now developing it for customers to use this model on our website.

              2) Customer Segmentation : We have many customers to buy the products of our business partners. To enhance the success rate of our marketing campaigns, I am developing a customer segmentation model for targeted marketing.

              3) Algorithm Detection : One of our top priorities is to expose our customers' products at the top of the search result site. Therefore, changes in the search algorithms are crucial to our business. I have identified the key variables that significantly impact search algorithms, as well as the timings of algorithm changes.

          At KHU, I learnt various business problems specializing in the hospitality industry. While the major was industry-specific, the methodology I have learnt was generalizable; statistics and business analytics allowed me to pursue an MSc in quantitative marketing.
