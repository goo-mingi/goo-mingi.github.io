            As a Data Scientist at Storelink, I focus on online marketplaces. Below are some of the market analysis projects I have carried out:

              1) <mark>Brand Involvement Analysis</mark> : While consumers tend to refer to the rank when they purchase in online markets, some products are more influenced by their brands than the rank itself. We call this **Keywords in High Brand Involvement**. This model analyzes whether the products from the result of a keyword have high brand involvement or not. This model has become a **core competence** of my company, and we are now developing it for customers to use this model on our website.


              2) <mark>Customer Segmentation</mark> : We have many customers to buy the products of our business partners. To enhance the success rate of our marketing campaigns, I am developing a **customer segmentation model for targeted marketing**.


              3) <mark>Algorithm Detection</mark> : One of our top priorities is to expose our customers' products at the top of the search result site. Therefore, changes in the search algorithms are crucial to our business. I have identified the key variables that significantly impact search algorithms, as well as the timings of algorithm changes.
